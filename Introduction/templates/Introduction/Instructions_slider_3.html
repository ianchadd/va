      <strong> <u> Example 3 </u> </strong>:
  </p>
  <p>
      Finally, consider the following puzzle.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="{% static 'puzzle_3_0.png' %}" width='200'/>
  </p>
  <p>
      This puzzle is more difficult than the previous two.

  <p>
      However, note that the top row is already in the correct order. So, let's keep the top row
      as it is and think about the remaining part.
      <strong> When the top line is in the correct order, you should
      always keep it as it is </strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
      You can then just isolate your attention to the part of the puzzle that is not already in the correct order:
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="{% static 'puzzle_3_0_2x3.png' %}" width='200'/>
  </p>
  <p>
      You could solve the puzzle by trial and error. However,
      there is also a general rule for solving the puzzle faster:
      <strong> after placing the top row in the correct order,
      you should proceed by arranging the left column in order
      correct </strong>.
      In this example there are two possible moves: move the 4 to the right
      or move the 7 down. What is the fastest way to fix
      the left column in the correct order based on how much we have
      just said?
